# Sweeter 16 : An ASM Tool (Web based - no installation required)

This repository contains the source code for my browser-based ASM tool that I use on my website.

The goal of this tool is to make it easy to work with assembly-style code in a clean, practical way and quickly produce an output that can be used in downstream steps (for example: testing programs, generating machine-code/hex-style output, or preparing input for a simulator/workflow).

## What this tool is about

- A web UI for working with ASM code in a fast, repeatable way
- Designed for quick iteration: edit → generate/convert → copy/use the result
- Kept in a Git repo so changes are tracked and updates are easy to publish

## Typical workflow

1. Write or paste ASM code into the tool
2. Use the tool to process/convert it into the desired output format
3. Copy/export the generated output and use it in the next step of your workflow

## Why this exists

When working with assembly-style programs, small edits are frequent and manual conversion steps become annoying and error-prone. This tool exists to reduce that friction and make the “write ASM → get usable output” loop smoother.

## What’s in this repository

- Frontend source code for the tool (web files)
- Everything needed to maintain and evolve the UI/logic over time
- History of changes via Git commits

## Feedback / Contributions

If you find a bug or have an idea that would make the tool better, feel free to open an issue (or a pull request if you want to contribute code).

## Notes

- The commit history acts as the change log.
- If a `LICENSE` file exists in this repository, it defines the licensing terms for this code.
